# WG Securing Critical Projects

This charter describes operations as an [OSSF Technical Initiative](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/master/charters/).
The [Focus](#focus) section below describes what is in and out of scope,
and [Governance](#governance) section describes how our operations are consistent with OSSF policies with links to more detailed documents.

**Mission:** TODO

## Motivation

<img align="right" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dependency.png">

Open Source Software has long suffered from a "tragedy of the commons" problem.
Organizations large and small make use of OSS every day, but many projects are struggling for the time, resources and attention they need.

This is a resource allocation problem - and we can help solve it together.
We need ways to connect critical projects we all rely on with organizations that can provide them with support.

Whether it is dedicated help from specialized experts or simply grant money or cloud credits, we recognize that no two
projects are the same, and support can come in many shapes.
We intend to work with upstream maintainers to understand what help and support they need, and then develop scalable processes to make
this help available.
